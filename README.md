[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrew-murray/tabit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrew-murray/tabit)

tabit is aimed to provide functionality around creating custom drum tab.
tabit primarily exists as my learning project for react but also supporting personal use.
tabit is in part based on experience using https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen and supports its .h2song format

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
