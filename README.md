## Overview

tabit helps drum crews learn tunes. It's both a drum-machine and a [drum-tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_tablature) viewer.
tabit is inspired by the Desktop application [Hydrogen](http://hydrogen-music.org/) and provides an importer for that format.

## Demo

## Edinburgh Drum Crews

tabit has been brewed from Edinburgh's drumming culture. The best-supported style of drum notation is endemic to that culture!
