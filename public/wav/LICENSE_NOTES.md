tabit currently relies on sound libraries made available under GPL and CC licenses and such is made available under the GPL too!
These dependencies are a little unclear on their exact license/terms (as they are hydrogen drumkits which currently means a very compact license declaration).

Specifically tabit packages these drumkits
   - TR808EmulationKit (ArtemioLabs [http://artemiolabs.com]) available under the GPL
   - GMRockKit (Glen MacArthur / Sebastian Moors) available under the GPL
   - The Black Pearl 1.0 (Glen MacArthur) available under the GPL
   - DeathMetal (archman) available under CC-Attribution
   - circAfrique v4 (Jim Harney) available under Creative Commons - Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported

These were sourced from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hydrogen/files/Sound%20Libraries/Main%20sound%20libraries/
In some cases this involved repackaging to .wav files using [convert.py](scripts/convert.py)
